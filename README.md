# OmicronPrevalence

Prevalence of BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 in A) Singapore, B) South Africa, C) the United States, and D) Worldwide over the last six months(since Nov 2021). Data were retrieved from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/, 5/18/2022) via the outbreak.info API.


# Antigenic cartography

Antigenic cartography was generated by the neutralization titer 50% (NT50) in  pseudoviruses (color circles) from all naive serum panels examined (naïve ancestral, n = 20; naïve Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, n = 16; and naïve SARS-CoV-1, n = 7). The x and y axes represent the antigenic distance, with the space of the grey grid lines showing 1 Antigenic Unit (2-fold dilution in titer). 

Antigenic cartography was generated by the neutralization titer 50% (NT50) in pseudoviruses (color circles) from all vaccinated serum panels (BNT162b2 x2, BNT162b2 x3, BNT162b2 x2/mRNA-1273, BNT162b2 x2/Omicron-breakthrough, BNT162b2x3/Omicron-breakthrough, and SARS-vaccinated) examined (n = 99, uncolored squares). The x- and y-axes represent the antigenic distance, with the space of the grey grid lines showing 1 Antigenic Unit (2-fold dilution in titer). Heatmap on the right bottom indicates the antigenic unit distance between SARS-CoV-2, Omicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2 L452R, BA.2 F486V, BA.4/BA.5 and SARS-CoV-1.
